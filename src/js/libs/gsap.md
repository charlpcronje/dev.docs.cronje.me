### Crazy fast

Performance is paramount, especially on mobile devices with sluggish processors. Silky smooth animation is the hallmark of any `library` worth its weight and `GSAP` outperforms old `industry standards` by literally `1000%+` under stress. What was jerky and twitchy is now fluid. It's the result of countless optimizations made to ensure that your interactive projects are `responsive`, `efficient`, and buttery smooth. Check out the speed test for a head-to-head comparison.

### Freakishly robust

JavaScript animation built for professionals, `GSAP` is packed with features that make most other engines look like cheap toys. Animate `colors`, `beziers`, `css` properties, `Arrays`, and lots more. Build jaw-dropping scroll-triggered effects. `Round values`, `smoothly reverse()` on the fly, use relative values, automatically accommodate `getter`/`setter` functions, employ virtually any easing equation, and manage conflicting `tweens` like a pro. Define callbacks, build sequences effortlessly (even with overlapping `tweens`), `repeat`/`yoyo` and so much more.

### Compatible

`HTML`, `SVG`, `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, `jQuery`, `Canvas`, `CSS`, new browsers, old browsers, mobile, and more - `GSAP` gets along with them famously. Use your favorite tools without jumping through endless hoops to ensure compatibility. GSAP "just works". We worry about compatibility so that you don't need to. Another headache solved.

### Animate anything

That's right. Anything. No predefined list of properties to choose from. Any numeric property of any object can be animated. `GSAP` handles complex string values with nested colors in almost any format. It automatically senses function-based values. There are tons of utility methods for solving common problems. The possibilities are endless.

### Lightweight & expandable

Modular, flexible, and ultra-efficient, its plugin architecture keeps the core engine tight while allowing virtually any feature to be added via optional plugins. `GSAP` packs an amazing amount of power into a surprisingly small package.

### Zero dependencies

The `GSAP` isn't built on top of any 3rd party tools like jQuery (although it works great with `jQuery`). This approach minimizes load times and maximizes performance.

### Advanced sequencing

You're not limited to `one-after-the-other` sequencing; have animations overlap as much as you want. Nest timelines inside other timelines. Insert gaps, `callbacks`, labels, staggered tweens, and more. You get precise control over timing and unprecedented flexibility to create expressive animations with minimal code.

### Dedicated support

Everybody needs a little help sometimes. We've got your back. When deadlines are looming and you canâ€™t figure something out, hop over to `greensock.com`/forums to get your GSAP-related questions answered. There are over 100,000 posts! GreenSock tools are unlike most open source projects that stagnate or offer zero support.

### Permissive license

Completely free for everything except a very specific type of commercial use (reselling to multiple customers), GreenSock's license makes it extremely accessible and business-friendly while providing a small funding mechanism to sustain ongoing support, enhancement, and innovation. The web is littered with abandoned "open source" projects, but GreenSock has a years-long track record of commitment to the platform.
