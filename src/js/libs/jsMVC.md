A small JavaScript framework to implement mvc style navigation in a single page web application.

I found this a while ago, I thought it was a nice intro into JS MVC framworks and it will give you a good understanding of how frameworks like this work. I did implement a small project based on this once, I did have some of my own ideas which I implemented, also this code base is old by now so there are a lot of ways to improve upon the this by now. But still I think this is worth haveing a look at. 

Also the creator of this example has a nice Youtube video explaining the whole thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0rqPfRfEfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0rqPfRfEfU)
